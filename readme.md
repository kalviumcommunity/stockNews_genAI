# Stock Market News AI

## Project Overview
The **Stock Market News AI** is an intelligent tool designed to fetch, analyze, and summarize recent news related to a specific stock, then provide a sentiment-based performance overview. The goal is to help investors, traders, and researchers quickly understand how a stock is performing and what the current sentiment is around it, without manually reading dozens of articles.

The project works by:
1. Fetching recent news articles about a given stock symbol.
2. Extracting key points from each article.
3. Performing sentiment analysis on the aggregated news data.
4. Providing an overall performance assessment of the stock along with the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative).

## How the AI Works

The system will be implemented using a combination of **Prompting**, **Structured Output**, **Function Calling**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.  
Here’s how each concept will be applied:

### 1. Prompting
**What it is:** Prompting refers to the way we design the instructions for the AI model so it understands exactly what to do.  
**In our project:**  
- We'll create carefully crafted prompts that tell the model:
  - Which stock we're analyzing.
  - What type of news data it has to look for.
  - How to perform sentiment analysis.
  - How to summarize the performance in a human-readable way.
- Example prompt for sentiment analysis:
  ```
  You are a financial sentiment analyst. Analyze the following news headlines about {STOCK_NAME}. 
  Classify the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, and provide a 1-2 sentence justification.
  Headlines:
  1. ...
  2. ...
  ```
- We'll use few-shot prompting by giving examples of past inputs and outputs to improve accuracy.

### 2. Structured Output
**What it is:** Structured output ensures that the AI’s response follows a fixed format (like JSON or key-value pairs) for easy parsing and further processing.  
**In our project:**  
- We'll instruct the AI to always return results in JSON format, such as:
  ```json
  {
    "stock": "AAPL",
    "timeframe": "Last 7 days",
    "sentiment_summary": "Positive",
    "confidence_score": 0.87,
    "performance_overview": "Apple's stock sentiment has been positive due to strong quarterly earnings.",
    "top_news": [
      {"headline": "Apple reports record profits", "sentiment": "Positive"},
      {"headline": "Apple faces supply chain issues", "sentiment": "Negative"}
    ]
  }
  ```
- This makes it easier for our frontend or dashboard to visualize the data.

### 3. Function Calling
**What it is:** Function calling allows the AI to trigger specific backend functions during its reasoning process.  
**In our project:**  
- The AI can decide when to call functions such as:
  - `fetch_news(stock_symbol, days)`
  - `analyze_sentiment(news_articles)`
  - `generate_stock_summary(sentiment_results)`
- For example:
  1. The user says: "Tell me about Tesla stock performance this week."
  2. The AI recognizes that it needs recent Tesla news → calls `fetch_news("TSLA", 7)`.
  3. After getting the articles, it calls `analyze_sentiment(...)`.
  4. It then combines the analysis and returns the final report.

### 4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**What it is:** RAG enhances AI answers by retrieving relevant external data and feeding it into the model before it generates the output.  
**In our project:**  
- We'll use RAG to:
  - Pull real-time news articles from APIs like Google News, NewsAPI, or Alpha Vantage.
  - Store these articles temporarily in a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS) so that the AI can search and retrieve the most relevant pieces.
  - Pass this retrieved information into the AI prompt so it always bases its analysis on factual, recent data rather than outdated training data.
- Example flow:
  1. Retrieve last 7 days of stock-related news.
  2. Embed and store articles in the vector database.
  3. When asked about the stock, retrieve top N relevant articles.
  4. Feed them into the AI for final sentiment and performance evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js / Python
- AI Model: OpenAI GPT (with Function Calling & JSON Structured Output)
- Data Source: NewsAPI / Google News RSS / Alpha Vantage
- Database: Vector DB (Pinecone / FAISS)
- Frontend: React (optional for dashboard)
- Hosting: Vercel / Render / AWS

## Example User Flow
1. **User Input:** "Analyze Apple's stock sentiment for the past 5 days."
2. **Backend:** 
   - Calls news API to fetch relevant articles.
   - Embeds and stores them in the vector DB.
3. **AI Model:**
   - Retrieves top relevant articles.
   - Performs sentiment analysis.
   - Generates structured JSON output with performance summary.
4. **Output to User:**
   ```
   Stock: AAPL
   Sentiment: Positive (Confidence: 87%)
   Summary: Strong earnings reports and positive analyst forecasts have driven upbeat sentiment.
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time price tracking alongside sentiment.
- Integrate social media sentiment (Twitter, Reddit).
- Provide trend prediction based on historical sentiment patterns.
